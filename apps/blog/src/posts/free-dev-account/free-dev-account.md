We are excited to announce a new program to empower PWA developers to bring their ideas and experiences to Windows, for FREE. For a limited time, in partnership with the Microsoft Store, Microsoft Store developer account tokens will be available (approximately $19 each) to developers that own qualifying PWAs and wish to make those available to Windows users via Microsoft Store. Just [enter your PWA url here](https://aka.ms/getToken) to get started.

## Why Publish your PWA to the Microsoft Store?

PWAs are first class applications on Windows and can be indistinguishable from apps built with native technology. In fact, some of the most popular and engaging apps on Windows today are PWAs, including [Goodnotes](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/goodnotes-for-windows/9N92MC09DB30), [Adobe Express](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/adobe-express/9P94LH3Q1CP5), and [Elk](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/elk/9PNZMMXQHQZ5). The Microsoft Store is available to over one billion users on Windows 10 and 11, offering a huge reach and potential audience for your apps on Windows. By packaging and publishing your PWA to the Microsoft Store, you can increase the discoverability of your app and broaden your user base. Additionally, the Microsoft Store provides a trusted platform for users to find and install apps, giving your PWA more credibility and visibility.

## How Does it Work?

Starting August 15th, and ending September 15th, limited number of developers that own qualifying PWAs will be able to claim a token that will enable them to create a developer account for publishing apps to the Microsoft Store for free. To qualify for a free developer account, your PWA must meet our quality standards, including: 

- Your PWA is installable from the browser, 
- Your web manifest has all requested fields that describe and define your PWA, and
- You have implemented two or more desktop integrations like shortcuts or Window controls overlay. 

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your PWA delivers great user experience across different devices and platforms. 

Once your PWA meets the quality criteria, we will provide you with a token to create a free developer account. This token eliminates the (approximately) $19 account registration fee, making it more accessible for developers to publish their apps.
