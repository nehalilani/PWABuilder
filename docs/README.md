## PWA Starter 

The PWA Starter is our opinionated and production tested starter that the PWABuilder team uses to build all of our PWAs, including PWABuilder itself. 

The PWA Starter uses a lightweight, fast, and extensible stack that allows you to quickly get started with developing a new PWA. 

It comes with the key pieces of any PWA, including a manifest and service worker functionality through [Workbox.](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)

To learn more about the starter's tech stack and how to develop on it, take a look at the [quick start.](/starter/quick-start)

## PWABuilder Studio

PWABuilder Studio is an extension for Visual Studio Code that provides tooling for working with and creating progressive web apps.

You can use PWABuilder Studio to:

* Create a new PWA using the starter template
  
* Convert an existing web app into a PWA
  
* Manage your appâ€™s manifest, service workers, and icons
  
* Package your apps for the Microsoft, Google, and Apple Stores
  
* Validate your PWA across several metrics
  
* Add web capabilities with code snippets
